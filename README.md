# KrillBuild

KrillBuild is a build framework for creating cross-language/architecture/OS binaries. It tries to take out some the overhead work of maintaining cross-compilation toolchains by utilizing containers to seemlessly compile. KrillBuild focuses on creating static binaries that can be easy run on target systems without extra libraries.
