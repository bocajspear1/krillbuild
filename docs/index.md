# KrillBuild

KrillBuild is a framework for static cross-compilation. It focuses on building individual tools for other architectures and creating binary variations.

KrillBuild is for you if:

- You want static, no dependency binaries for different architectures.
- You want to take a single tool and make it cross-architecture.
- You want to make variations of static binaries.

KrillBuild is NOT for you if:

- You have a large project you want to cross compile
